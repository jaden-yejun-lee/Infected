# Infected
Infected is a First-Person Shooter Zombie Game developed through Blueprint classes in Unreal Engine. 

Some of the main development points include: 
  - Adapting BlendSpace to provide smooth animations for player arm and pistol synchronization, progressing to an accurate line trace that originates from pistol
  - Integrating PawnSensing AI within zombiesâ€™ chase logic, checking for successful collision range, in which zombie attacks player, who loses health
  - Engineering a GameMode class to incorporate wave-based gameplay logic, spawning different numbers of zombies on opposite sides of map, along with ammo crates that spawn at      random locations at the start of each new wave
  - Fashioning both in-game UI displaying ammo, current wave, blood overlay, and number of zombies left, in addition to general UI suited for the main menu and win/death         screens

However, the size of the whole project surpasses 5GB of data, which makes it extremely difficult to publish through Github. As a result, I will attach video gameplay showcasing different aspects of the game. 

The "Progress Notes" file also displays the development process I went through and what I accomplished during each work session. 

Infected was my first project working with Unreal Engine and it mainly served as an introductory project for me to get used to the different capabilites of Unreal Engine as well as the resources it offers. Credit to SmartPoly.
